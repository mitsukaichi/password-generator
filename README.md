# password-generator

## About this project

This project was done as the third assignment of a UC Berkeley Full Stack web developer coding bootcamp to learn about the basics of Javascript.

I was given base HTML / CSS / Javascript files to make a webpage that meets the follwing criteria:

- user is presented with a series of prompts for password criteria by clicking the button to generate a password
- user can select which criteria to include in the password
- user can choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
- user can choose whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
- user's input is validated and at least one character type should be selected
- once user answer all the prompts, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
- once the password is generated, the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
